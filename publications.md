The Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) peer-to-peer enterprise system is an
interagency and international effort led by the U.S. Department of Energy, and
co-funded by National Aeronautics and Space Administration, National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, National Science Foundation, as well as
international laboratories including the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology,
the German Climate Computing Centre, the Australian National University/National
Computational Infrastructure, and the British Atmospheric Data Center.

The Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF, esgf.org) is an international
collaboration for the software that powers most global climate change research,
notably assessments by the International Panel on Climate Change. The portal
below is for the Program for Climate Modeling Diagnosis and Intercomparison at
Livermore, one of dozens federated around the world.

### 2009

#### <a href="media/pdf/Lessons-learned-from-moving-esg.pdf" target="_blank">Lessons learned from moving Earth System Grid data sets over a 20 Gbps wide-area network</a>
In this paper, we report on obstacles overcome and the key lessons learned in
moving a small portion (10 TB) of the multimodel Coupled Model Intercomparison
Project, Phase 3 data set used in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report from three
sources&mdash;the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF), Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory (LLNL), and National Energy Research Scientific Computing
Center (NERSC)&mdash;to the 2009 Supercomputing conference (SC09) show floor in
Portland, Oregon.


#### <a href="media/pdf/ExpReports-ESG-SC09_final.pdf" target="_blank">Experience Report on the Supercomputing 2009 Bandwidth Challenge from the Perspective of the Earth System Grid</a>
The Supercomputing 2009 (SC09) Bandwidth Challenge entry titled, “High
Performance GridFTP Transport of Earth System Grid (ESG) Data,” demonstrated
high-performance GridFTP transport of climate data from multiple Department of
Energy laboratories to the targeted SC09 showroom floor. The transferred
multi-terabyte data consisted of a small portion of the multi-model Coupled
Model Intercomparison Project, Phase 3 (CMIP-3) data set used in the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4).
