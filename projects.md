## ESGF Node Projects

The ESGF Node is the central project.  It is an amalgam of several
sub-projects and external software components and libraries to create a single
Data Node artifact capable of searching, sharing and posting large amounts of
metadata.

* Harvests, publishes, replicates and maintains meta data.
* Primary feature component for performing meta data harvesting, publishing
and maintenance. Features pluggable handler design architecture for multi
data format support.

* The identity provider in the ESGF SSO federation as well as account management
and access control system. Also including a web-based interface for site
administrators.
* Identity Provider and User Manager
* Where users are managed and identities kept.
* Identity, security, naming, access, people

<img src="{{site.url}}/media/images/orp.png" class="project-icon">

* The OpenID Relying Party - relays end-users to their home organization's IDP
(identity provider) for secure login and connection to *local* resources
* OpenID relying party
* Provides the federation of nodes the ability to have single sign-on, with
OpenID support.
* Single sign-on

<img src="{{site.url}}/media/images/security.png" class="project-icon">

* Security infrastructure for nodes and federation.
* Security infrastructure protecting data integrity and access on each node and
across the federation.

### search

##### [Source][ESGF/esg-search], [Issues][ESGF/esg-search/issues], [Wiki][ESGF/esg-search/wiki]

<img src="{{site.url}}/media/images/search.png" class="project-icon">

* Search mechanism that supports search across entire corpus of ever-changing
published metadata.
* The ESGF search module contains the next generation search functionality for
the Earth System Grid Federation, built upon the Apache Solr search engine. The
package contains functionality for:
  * Publishing and unpublishing search metadata records into and from a Solr
  server. Metadata records are generated by harvesting a remote metadata source
  (a hierarchy of THREDDS catalogs, a OAI repository, a CAS metadata catalog).
  * Searching the Solr engine content via a free text, faceted search or a
  geo-spatial and temporal search.

### Compute

##### [Source][ESGF/esgf-cwt], [Issues][ESGF/esgf-cwt/issues]

<img src="{{site.url}}/media/images/compute.png" class="project-icon">

* The ESGF Compute Node is a common installation like the Data Node
* Deployed through recipes to enable server-side processing as an alternative to file download
* Built upon OGC Web Processing Service (WPS) for standards-compliance and interoperability
* Leveraging work from international activities to deliver robust subsetting and more advanced processing capabilities
* Scalable deployment on a range of architectures
* Reliant on large unit test coverage to support maintainability and product-readiness
