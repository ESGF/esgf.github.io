      <h2>ESGF Governance</h2>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>The Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) Review Board (ERB) is a group of
individuals whose goal is to advance ESGF technology by providing direction and
oversight to its development. While the open-source nature of ESGF allows
natural progression via its many contributors and collaborations, the board
provides synergy and cohesion among the various development efforts, thus
ensuring that changes will benefit the community as a whole. The ERB serves the
following functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintains a roadmap of ESGF, including long-term plans.</li>
<li>Makes decisions on high-impact code changes to ESGF.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ERB is composed of:
    1. The steering committee, funding agencies and stakeholders responsible for
    providing resources.
    2. The executive committee, which has overall responsibility for meeting
    sponsors, stakeholders, and community needs and prioritizing work.
    3. The technical committee, responsible for the development of the system
    architecture, the management of the development lifecycle and scheduling
    releases.</p>
<p>The executive and technical committees are responsible for setting release
contents and reporting what was actually delivered in the releases to the
community.</p>
<h3>Scope of ERB Intervention</h3>
<p>Code changes with a high impact on developers and/or users are to be reviewed by
the ERB committees. Guiding principles for deciding whether a change require ERB
involvement include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Will the change significantly affect backwards compatibility?</li>
<li>Will the change significantly affect users, managers, or developers?</li>
<li>Does the change significantly shift the functionality and scope of ESGF?</li>
<li>Are there any licensing issues?</li>
<li>Are there any security concerns that need to be addressed?</li>
</ul>
<p>Bug fixes do not in general require ERB approval. Small feature additions do not
require approval provided they are part of an associated development plan (see
Managing the Development Process on the ESGF website). In both cases, changes
must be formally documented and published to the mailing list and/or tracking
web sites for comment before implementation.</p>
<h3>Roles</h3>
<h4>Chair and co-Chairs</h4>
<p>The Chair or co-Chairs organize meeting agendas and maintains the roadmap and
the list of outstanding proposals that require ERB intervention. He/she (or
group) is also responsible for setting up ERB meeting times/places and ensuring
that the goals of the meeting are accomplished. The Chair or co-Chairs may
invite individuals or groups who have submitted proposals to present their plans
at ERB meetings.</p>
<p>In the case of a single Chair, the Deputy Chair keeps records of each meeting,
assists in the setup of the meeting location and technology (e.g. projectors,
video conferencing, etc.) required, and facilitates communication of proposals
to the ERB, as well as decisions from the ERB back to the community. The Deputy
Chair may act as Chair if the Chair is unavailable. In the case of co-Chairs,
overall responsibilities are equally shared. 
The Chair or co-Chairs are
responsible for facilitating discussions and consensus building in their
perspective committees.</p>
<h4>Voting members</h4>
<p><em>For each committee, there can be only one voting member per institution.</em>
Voting members candidates, one per institution, must be vetted and approved by
the respective committees and Chairs or co-Chairs. Voting member candidates must
be participant members for at least one year before being nominated as a voting
member.
Non-voting members
Non-voting members on the executive committee must
be voting members on the technical committee and non-voting members on the
technical committee must be voting members on the executive committee.
Non-voting members will be allowed to join meetings and participate, but are not
allowed to vote. The respective committees must vote non-voting members in.</p>
<h4>Participant members</h4>
<p>Each committee can invite participants to join meetings. Participants are guests
and hold no voting privileges. They may contribute to the code base and
participate in meetings on limited bases.</p>
<h3>Conflict Resolution</h3>
<p>Conflicts are to be resolved by discussion and consensus wherever possible. When
such an agreement is impossible, the members of the ERB committees vote on the
issue, with the <strong>Chair</strong> and <strong>co-Chairs</strong> breaking any tie vote.</p>
<h3>Committees</h3>
<h4>Steering Committee (SC) Responsibility</h4>
<p>Comprised of program managers whose agencies provide significant sources of
identified and dedicated funding and resources for ESGF development and core
infrastructure.</p>
<p>The SC will be initially populated by members named in the Steering Committee
Membership document as an addendum to this document. The SC provides a forum for
ESGF funding agencies to interact on a regular basis regarding the vision,
goals, and progress of the ESGF effort as they relate to each agency's mission
and plans. Agency representatives work with the ESGF executive and technical
committees to articulate ESGF goals and formulate metrics that reflect
programmatic requirements. The executive committee reports to the SC on the
status of ESGF development, adoption, and collaborations, and offers guidance
as warranted.</p>
<p>A program manager designated by the Climate and Environmental Sciences Division
within the DOE Office of Science will Chair the SC. The Chair in consultation
with other agency representatives who support ESGF will determine the funding
threshold for membership on the Steering Committee.</p>
<p>Role of the steering committee:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communicate agency objectives and constraints to the EC to ensure that they
are reflected in ESGF goals and vision</li>
<li>Review and concur on ESGF programmatic metrics proposed by the EC, and changes
to those metrics as may be necessary from time to time</li>
<li>Advise on funding issues and opportunities that may be relevant to continued
progress</li>
<li>Ensure significant sponsoring agencies are represented on the SC</li>
</ul>
<h4>Executive Committee (EC) Responsibility</h4>
<p>General guidance and overall high-level decisions in directing the course of the
ESGF project in correspondence with multiple sponsor and stakeholders
needs—ultimate responsibility for ensuring that ESGF meets the needs of
customers and stakeholders.</p>
<p>The EC will be initially populated by members named in the Executive Committee
Membership document as an addendum to this document.</p>
<p>Future EC membership shall develop organically from the EC itself. EC members
are responsible for nominating new members, who are elected by consensus or
majority vote (with the Chair breaking any tie). Members may step down from the
EC at any point. Members may be expelled from the EC by consensus or vote if
they are unable to attend meetings after reasonable effort has been made to
contact them, or if their actions are found to be counterproductive to the
purposes of the ERB.</p>
<p>The executive committee is responsible for organizing and interacting with the
ESGF Steering, Technical and Advisory committees. The steering
committee&mdash;composing of sponsors, stakeholders, and users&mdash;provides input to the
EC on the entire ESGF project and path forward from their perspective. This
input will be interpreted and used to provide requirements to the technical
committee. The executive committee will appoint a steering committee Chair and
the executive committee Chair must attend all steering committee meetings. The
Chair, when permitted, will attend all technical committee meetings to provide
input.</p>
<p>Role of the executive committee:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting the strategic direction of the ESGF project</li>
<li>Oversight of technical committee (and other committees as defined by the
executive committee)</li>
<li>Work with Technical Committee to review implantation plan for strategic goals</li>
<li>Approval of major architectural changes</li>
<li>Appoint an Advisory Committee of users and external stakeholders who will
provide feedback to the EC and TC on plans and suggestions for new directions</li>
</ul>
<h4>Technical Committee (TC) Responsibility</h4>
<p>Guidance and direction on technical issues set by executive committee
requirements—focused on technical aspects of ESGF.</p>
<p>The TC will be initially populated by members named in the Technical Committee
Membership document as an addendum to this document.
Future TC membership shall develop organically from the TC itself. TC members
are responsible for nominating new members who are elected by consensus or
majority vote (with the <strong>Chair</strong> or <strong>co-Chairs</strong> breaking any tie). Technical
members may step down from the TC at any point. Members may be expelled from the
TC by consensus or vote if they are unable to attend meetings after reasonable
effort has been made to contact them or if their actions are found to be
counterproductive to the purposes of the ERB.</p>
<p>The Chair or co-Chairs will attend all executive and technical committee
meetings to provide input.</p>
<p>Role of the technical committee:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requirements analysis (interfaces with customers - users - to understand
requirements)</li>
<li>Technical architecture</li>
<li>Organizing development</li>
<li>Testing and releases</li>
</ul>
<h3>Meetings</h3>
<p>The executive and technical committees will meet with their respective
constituents regularly, no less than monthly. The ERB committees will hold a
joint meeting on a schedule of their choosing and convenience no less than four
times a year. Additionally, the committees may meet informally at any time when
the need arises. The EC will schedule meetings with the Advisory Committee on an
annual basis. These meetings may occur via telecom, e-mail, or face-to-face. At
least one face-to-face meeting will occur each year. (Meeting notes and
scheduled meetings are to be posted on the ESGF website.) The Chairs of the EC
and TC committees will communicate no less than once a month.</p>      <hr>
