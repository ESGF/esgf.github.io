## ESGF Mission

The Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) is an international collaboration for
the software that powers most global climate change research, notably
assessments by the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change][ipcc] (IPCC).   

ESGF manages the first-ever decentralized database for handling climate science
data, with multiple petabytes of data at dozens of federated sites worldwide. It
is recognized as the leading infrastructure for the management and access of
large distributed data volumes for climate change research. It supports the
[Coupled Model Intercomparison Project][cmip] (CMIP), whose protocols enable the
periodic assessments carried out by the IPCC.

Using a system of geographically distributed peer nodes&mdash;independently
administered yet united by common protocols and interfaces&mdash;the ESGF
community holds the premier collection of simulations and observational and
reanalysis data for climate change research. ESGF is in the early stages of
being adapted for use in two additional domains: biology (to accelerate drug
design and development) and energy (infrastructure for [California Energy
Systems for the 21st Century][ces21] (CES21)).
