The [Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF)](https://esgf.llnl.gov/2020-F2F.html) is an international collaboration for the software that powers most global climate change research, notably assessments by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). It supports the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP), and the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM).
 
ESGF manages the first-ever decentralized database for handling climate science data, with multiple petabytes of data at dozens of federated sites worldwide. A big part of its success can be attributed to the collaborative nature of the project. International teams have come together to build a federated data management system to enable climate scientists achieve scientific breakthroughs. The teams meet annually to share achievements, discuss challenges, and listen to user requirements. 
 
We would like to invite you to [submit an abstract](https://www.cvent.com/c/abstracts/d711d763-6850-43d6-95db-08b8304c1b69) and [register](https://is.enes.org/events/workshops/9th-esgf-face-to-face-conference) for the 9th Annual Earth System Grid Federation Conference that will be held in Toulouse, France on March 23-25.
 
The main theme of the conference will be “Future ESGF architecture”. Topics of interest include:
 
* Infrastructure, Installation, and security for federated architectures
* Metrics collection and dashboards
* User Interfaces, search, subscription and user notification
* Scalable compute infrastructure, analysis and visualization tools
* Identity and authorization management
* Software testing and CI
* Search infrastructure, indexing, metadata, data quality control, publishing
* User support, documentation, publicity, newsletter, communication
* Hardware & Storage
* Data transfer tools
* Replication
* ESGF and Cloud computing
 
In addition, this year we invite the ESGF user community to submit abstracts that describe use cases and/or science requirements.
