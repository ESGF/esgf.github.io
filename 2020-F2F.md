Hello everyone;
 
The 9th Annual ESGF F2F 2020 conference is being cancelled due to travel restrictions and potential health repercussions related to the COVID-19 (Coronavirus). The severity of the impacts of this virus are extreme and significantly impact the entire world. Unanimously, the ESGF Executive Committee agreed with the decision to cancel the March conference while we also agreed to reschedule the event at a later time. In the meantime, we intend to host a 2-hour architecture focused seminar via Web-EX that will be coordinated and led by Sasha Ames and Phil Kershaw.
 
Deepest apologies for any inconveniences that you may be experiencing with the cancellation of the conference. It will take a bit of time (several weeks), but please know that all registration fees will be reimbursed. If you have any questions related to this matter, please contact [Sophie Morellon](mailto:sophie.morellon@lsce.ipsl.fr?subject=REIMBURSEMENT:%209th%20Annual%20ESGF%20F2F%202020).
 
Thank you for your understanding and continued support. Both [Michael Lautenschlager and myself](mailto:lautenschlager@dkrz.de?subject=FUTURE%20ESGF%20Meetings) are available to answer any questions or concerns that you may have related to future ESGF meetings.
