## Federated ESGF Nodes

As of 28 May 2025 ESGF is undergoing an interim period prior to migrating to a "Next-Generation" Index.  During this short period, data discovery is partitioned into two domains: DOE/US and Europe/AU nodes.  Not all data is replicated among both domain.  If an expected dataset does not appear in one domain then the search may need to be repeated in the other.


### Metagrid Nodes - Europe/AU

These sites run the React-based Metagrid Web Application

* [CEDA](https://esgf-ui.ceda.ac.uk/search)

* [NCI](https://esgf.nci.org.au)

### Metagrid Nodes - DOE/US 

* [LLNL](https://esgf-node.llnl.gov) 
* [ORNL](https://esgf-node.ornl.gov)

### CoG Nodes - Europe/AU

These sites run the *legacy* Django-based CoG Web Application.  Please note that OpenID logins do not work on several of these systems.
