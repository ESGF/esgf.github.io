## Installation & distribution
[README] | [Bootstrap script][bootstrap] | [License] | [Releases]

Please read the [README] file. It provides a step by step overview of the
installation process.

Also please be sure to have the necessary prerequisites installed on your
system (see the [README]). Please do this **before** you do anything else.

The installation is an interactive process where the user is prompted for input.
To help manage your expectations of the installation process, the following
should give you a ballpark idea:

* The entire process takes approximately an hour.
* There are about a 20 prompts for user input - almost all of which have
resonable defaults (you can just hit enter - recommended).
* The lion's share of the time is spent building the various tools and
executables (heads up: globus and python take a relatively long time to build).

We have worked hard to make the installation of the ESGF Node rather painless.
Please peruse our [wiki] and join our [mailing lists][mailinglist] where you may
post any questions and/or issues regarding the installation processes or any
other ESGF node related topic.  Also stay in the loop with project announcements
and other information posted on our [twitter feed][twitter]. You may also subscribe to the blog's
[RSS feed] and read us in your favorite reader.
